# Design System

## Why

We want to achieve a redundancy across all of our projects: Every developer should be able to work in every project.
Therefore we need to use the same systems in the development.

One of them is a Design System: (S)CSS classes and styles to create flexible (and reusable) UIs.

## Structure

The design system is located in `libs/theme`.

```
libs/theme/src/lib/theme
├── abstracts
│   ├── _color.scss
│   ├── _spacing.scss
│   └── ...
├── ui
│   ├── _base.scss
│   ├── _reset.scss
│   ├── _typography.scss
│   └── ...
├── variables
│   ├── _base.scss
│   ├── _spacing.scss
│   └── ...
├── vendors
│   ├── primeng
│   └── primeflex
├── index.scss
├── storybook.scss
└── utilities.scss
```
- abstract: mixins and placeholders to generate ui.
- ui: contains base css (e.g. reset) and utility classes for color, spacing, typography, etc.
- variables: contains all relevant variables for the design system: base, colors, spacing, typography, etc.
- vendors: contains code of external dependencies. Right not it contains PrimeNg and Primeflex
  - Primeflex: contains a config of all utility classes used of primeflex
    - Entry Point: `./_primeflex.scss`
    - Update package `primeflex` for newer version
  - PrimeNg: contains the prime designer (all PrimeNg Styles with variables)
    - Entry Point: './custom/_variables.scss'
    - Update `https://git.team23.de/team23/primeone-designer-ng` and migrate `custom` and `designer` folder.

## Further Infos

- Colors
- Typography
- Spacing

## Usage
After configuration of the variables (in `./variables`) you are ready to go:

### Utility Classes
```html
<div class="mb-m background-primary">
    <div class="text-small color-text-on-primary"> ... <div>
</div>
```

### Custom CSS
There are different ways to use the different aspects of the design system in your custom component styles
#### Colors
Since colors are defined using css variables you can use them directly when needed:
```css
.card {
    color: var(--color-text-on-secondary);
    background-color: var(--background-secondary);
}
```
#### Spacing
Since spacing classes are generated based on a config it is not possible to include them directly. There is one mixin for all spacings:
```css
.card {
    @include set-spacing(pt-m);
    @include set-spacing(pl-m);
}
```
#### Typography
Since typography is defined explicitly it's not possible to use only one mixin. There is one mixin for every typography type
```css
.card {
    @include text-small;
    @include text-bold;
}
```
## open TODOs
- add prime designer as subtree
- avoid multiple `font-family` attributes when including multiple typography mixins
